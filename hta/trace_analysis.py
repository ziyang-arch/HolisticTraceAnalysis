        Notes:
            1. Find all communication kernels which pass the duration test, i.e., kernel duration > mean_iter_time * min_normalized_duration (the default value is 1%).
            2. Pick the last kernel for each combination of (iteration, rank, stream, kernel).
            3. For each combination of (iteration, stream, kernel), compute the standard deviation of the last kernel duration w.r.t. ranks.
            4. Compute the mean value of the last kernel duration standard deviation w.r.t. ranks across all available iterations. If there is only one iteration, the mean value would just be the std computed at 3.
            5. Select the (stream, kernel) combination which has the largest mean value computed at 4.
            6. Select the normalized start time for the (stream, kernel) combination as the candidate metric for detecting whether a rank will be a straggler.

            + This method forwards the analysis to the function hta.straggler.default_straggler_identification.
            + Because most distributed training jobs have one or multiple blocking synchronizations within an iteration, we define a straggler as the trainer which starts later than others and thus causes the largest slowdown of the overall training process.
            + Because empirical knowledge shows that all-to-all collective communication operators are most likely to have the largest impact on the training performance, this straggler analysis computes a default straggler metric as follows:
            + This metric is defined for each rank and for each iteration (excluding the last iteration if it should be ignored).
            + The metrics is passed into a straggler detection algorithm which picks the top k ranks ordered by the metric computed above for each iteration, where k is num_candidates.
            + For multiple iterations, it is possible that different iteration may return a different set of potential stragglers. The identify_potential_stragglers() will return the counts of how many times each rank is found to be a potential straggler.

        GPU is considered idle when no kernel is running on it. Idle time is broken down into 3 categories.

        1. Host wait time: a GPU or stream is idle because the CPU thread has not enqueued enough kernels to
           keep it occupied.
        2. Kernel wait time: This is the duration between kernels and is considered an overhead of
           launching multiple small kernels. We use the following heuristic to classify the duration as kernel wait:
           duration between consecutive kernels < ``consecutive_kernel_delay``.
        3. Other wait time: In this case the idle time is attributed to an unknown cause. For example, a compute
           kernel could be waiting for a CUDA event from a communication kernel to complete.

        Args:
            ranks (List[int]): List of ranks for which idle time breakdown is computed. Default = [0].
            streams (List[int]): List of streams to provide analysis for. Defaults to all streams.
            visualize (bool): Set to True to show the graph. Default = True.
            visualize_pctg (bool): Show relative percentage across streams. Default = True.
            show_idle_interval_stats (bool): Returns statistics of the idle intervals like the min, max
               and median of idle intervals between kernels on a CUDA stream, also broken down by
               the idleness category. Default = False.
            consecutive_kernel_delay (int): Configures the threshold under which we consider gaps between
                kernels to be due to realistic delays in launching back to back kernels on the GPU.
                Default = 30 nanoseconds.

        Returns:
            Tuple[pd.DataFrame, Optional[pd.DataFrame]]
                A tuple of dataframes. The first dataframe contains the idle time category and duration for each stream
                on each rank. The second dataframe contains the summary statistics (count, min, max, mean, standard deviation,
                25th, 50th, 75th percentile) for each idle category for each stream on each rank.

        """Performance counters measured on GPU kernels can provide insights on how to speed up GPU kernels. PyTorch profiler has an alternative lightweight API [CUPTI Range Profiler API](https://docs.nvidia.com/cupti/r_main.html#r_profiler) that enables users to program and measure detailed performance counters from the device.

        When the CUPTI Profiler mode is enabled the PyTorch will emit the performance measurement values annotated in the GPU kernel events in the trace.
        * The events are emitted under a `cuda_profiler_range` category
        * The counter values are contained inside the `args` json part of the trace.

        This trace analyzer can investigate performance measurements per kernel
        and associate them to operators that the kernel belongs to. A single kernel
        can map to multiple levels of operators (as operators can be nested).
        To represent this we basically provide a list column called `op_stack`.
        For further convenience we add the top and bottom level operator column as well.
